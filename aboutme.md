# 100-JS-coding-challenges (WIP)

Hi there ðŸ˜œ, this is a repo where I store all my data structure and algorithm challenges in JavaScript. The aim is to complete 100 coding challenges. 

The challenges are grouped according to kyu - which is rank in Japanese, in which:
- 8-kyu is the lowest rank
- 1-kyu is the highest rank 

The challenges cover several topics in JavaScript:
- regex 
- higher order function 
- array manipulation
- data manipulation/ parsing 

#### The project is a WIP until it reaches 100.
